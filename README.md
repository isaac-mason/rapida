*rÃ¡pida - fast*

`rapida` is a collection of javascript packages that make creating interactive 3d content for the web with three.js easy!

**rapida is under active alpha development and is not yet battle-tested and stable. We don't recommend using rapida in production just yet, but watch this space!**

- [x] Build out your 3D scenes with [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [x] Add complex logic to your world with the Entity Component System `@rapidajs/recs`
- [x] Simple API for handling multiple renderers and multiple views

```bash
> yarn add @rapidajs/rapida three
```
