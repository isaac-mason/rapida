*rÃ¡pida - fast*

`rapida` is a collection of javascript packages that make creating interactive 3d content for the web with three.js easy!

**rapida is under active alpha development and is not yet battle-tested and stable. We don't recommend using rapida in production just yet, but watch this space!**

- [x] Build out your 3D scenes with [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [x] Add physics to your world with `@rapidajs/rapida-physics`, which runs [cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es) in a web worker
- [x] Add complex logic to your world with the Entity Component System `@rapidajs/recs`
- [x] Simple API for handling multiple renderers and multiple views

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/rapida three@^0.133.0

# or yarn

> yarn add @rapidajs/rapida three@^0.133.0
```

The package `@rapidajs/rapida-physics` can also be used independently to add physics into your three scene!

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/rapida-physics

# or yarn

> yarn add @rapidajs/rapida-physics
```

> yarn workspaces focus @rapidajs/rapida

# alternatively, install all packages in the workplace to build examples
# note that one example requires node-datachannel which requires cmake to be installed
# see node-datachannel for system requirements: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-datachannel
> yarn install

# build and test all packages
> yarn run release

# Start storybook for all packages
> yarn run storybook

# Create a new changeset
