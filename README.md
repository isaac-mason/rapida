_rÃ¡pida - fast_

`rapida` is a collection of javascript packages that make creating interactive 3d content for the web with three.js easy!

**rapida is under active alpha development and is not yet battle-tested and stable. We don't recommend using rapida in production just yet, but watch this space!**
