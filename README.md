- [x] Build out your 3D scenes with [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [x] Add physics to your world with `rapida-physics`, which runs [cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es) in a web worker
- [x] Add complex logic to your world with the `rapida-ecs` Entity Component System
- [x] Simple API for handling multiple renderers and multiple views within renderers
- [x] Frontend framework/library agnostic - BYO frontend stack!

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/rapida three@^0.133.0
```

The package `@rapidajs/rapida-physics` can also be used standalone to bring physics into your three scene!

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/rapida-physics
```
