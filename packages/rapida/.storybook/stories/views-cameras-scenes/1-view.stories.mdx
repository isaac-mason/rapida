# Views

In many cases, your world will only have one view. Below is an example of a simple world with one camera, one scene, and one view.

Below is an example of a very simple world with only one view:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="views-cameras-scenes-one-view--example" />
</Canvas>

Worlds, of course, can have multiple views.

Here is an example of a world with two views, side by side:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="views-cameras-scenes-splitscreen--example" />
</Canvas>
