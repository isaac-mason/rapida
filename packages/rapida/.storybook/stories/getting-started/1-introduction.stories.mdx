# `@rapidajs/rapida`

Rapida is a library that helps you create 3D content with Javascript.

**Highlights**
- [x] Build your 3D scenes with three.js
- [x] Add physics to your game with the Cannon JS Physics Engine running in Web Workers
- [x] Framework agnostic - the reason to use this over something like react-three-fibre is this isn't tied to a frontend framework
- [x] Support for multiple cameras, scenes and views out of the box!
- [x] Support for AR and VR with WebXR
