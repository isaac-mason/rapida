Rapida is a game engine for 3D Physics games with Javascript.

**Highlights**
- 📷. Build your 3D scenes with three.js
- ⚽. Add physics to your game with the Cannon JS Physics Engine running in Web Workers
- 🌐. Framework agnostic - the reason to use this over something like react-three-fibre is this isn't tied to a frontend framework
- 📺📺🎭🎭. Supports multiple cameras, scenes and views out of the box!
