# recs

`recs` is the Rapida Entity Component System. It is used by `@rapidajs/rapida`, but can also be used standalone.

It is far from being a pure Entity Component System, but aims to provide some of the key benefits of using an ECS while also being flexible.

**rapida is under active alpha development and is not yet battle-tested and stable. We don't recommend using rapida in production just yet, but watch this space!**

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/recs

# or yarn

> yarn add @rapidajs/recs
```
