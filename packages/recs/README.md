recs - *Reminiscent [of an] Entity Component System*

`@rapidajs/recs` is the Rapida Entity Component System. It is used by `@rapidajs/rapida`, and can also be used standalone.

`recs` is far from being a pure Entity Component System. You can use `recs` as *~more* of a pure ECS with data-only `Components` belonging to `Entities` that are managed by `Systems` with `Queries`. You can also optionally add behavior to `recs` `Components` for classic unity-like Game Objects.

**rapida is under active alpha development and is not yet battle-tested and stable. We don't recommend using rapida in production just yet, but watch this space!**

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/recs
> yarn add @rapidajs/recs
```
