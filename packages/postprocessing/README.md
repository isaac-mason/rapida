# @rapidajs/postprocessing

**rapida is under active alpha development and is not yet battle-tested and stable. We don't recommend using rapida in production just yet, but watch this space!**

`@rapidajs/postprocessing` is a thin wrapper around [vanruesc/postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing) with typed effect factory functions.

It is used in `@rapidajs/rapida`, but can also be used standalone.

Over time this package will become simpler - this primarily hinges on types being added to `vanruesc/postprocessing`. 

```bash
> npm install @rapidajs/postprocessing
> yarn add @rapidajs/postprocessing
```
